## CHANGELOG

### 2026-02-28 (this session, part 6) — Per-Module CRUD Permissions
- **Backend**
  - `models.py`: `Role`, `RoleCreate`, `RoleUpdate` now include `modulePerms: Dict[str, Dict[str, bool]]` (e.g. `{"homework": {"create": true, "edit": true, "delete": false}}`).
  - `routers/auth.py`: `get_role_by_name` and `GET /api/roles` backfill `modulePerms: {}` for legacy role docs; login response carries `modulePerms` inside `roleDetails`.
- **Frontend**
  - `AuthContext.js`: `canEdit(perms, module?)`, new `canCreate(perms, module?)`, new `canDelete(perms, module?)`. Each checks `modulePerms[module][action]` first, then falls back to the global `canEdit` / `canDelete` flag (backward compatible).
  - `Roles.js`: redesigned Module Access UI. Each module row has a toggle plus inline C / E / D colored buttons (emerald / sky / rose). Top-right "+C / +E / +D all" shortcuts bulk-apply to every selected module. Auto-migration on edit: when a legacy role with `canEdit: true` is opened, every assigned module is pre-seeded with C=E=true (D=role.canDelete) so admins can fine-tune without losing access. Global `canEdit` / `canDelete` flags renamed to *(fallback)* in the description.
  - Pages updated to pass module key: Students/Classes/Homework/EventCalendar/Expenses/Inventory/StaffPage/Complaints.
- **Testing** — `iteration_18.json`: 6/6 backend pytest + 9/9 frontend e2e PASS. Module-level permissions work; legacy roles unaffected; fallback gating verified on Homework page for both teacher (view-only) and admin (full access via fallback).

### 2026-02-28 (this session, part 5) — TOTAL ADMIN PORTAL REDESIGN + Collapsible Sidebar
- **Brand new design system** (user choice: surprise me / emerald accent / consistent page headers): warm school-admin aesthetic with deep slate-950 sidebar + emerald-500 accents + light cream-tinted content.
- **Layout** (`Layout.js` rewrite): dark slate-950 sidebar; nav grouped into **Academics / Finance / People / System**; active item shows emerald gradient bg + left accent bar + emerald-300 text; user footer with avatar, name, role, and logout. Mobile drawer slides in from the left with the same dark theme.
- **Collapsible sidebar**: circular chevron button on the right edge toggles 256 px ↔ 72 px with 300 ms transition. Choice persisted in `localStorage['sidebar-collapsed']`. Auto-collapses on first load when `1024 ≤ window.innerWidth < 1100` (only if user hasn't set a preference).
- **Consistent page header decoration**: `index.css` adds an emerald gradient vertical accent bar (5 px wide, rounded pill) before every `<main> h1.tracking-tight` — works automatically across all 12 admin pages without per-file edits. Cards get a refined dual-shadow.
- **Dashboard refresh**: slate-950 → emerald-950 dark hero with radial blobs; greeting now personalises with the logged-in user's first name; stat cards switched to emerald/teal/rose/amber palette; quick-actions use emerald-teal, sky-indigo, amber-orange gradients.
- **New shared component**: `PageHeader.js` available for future explicit headers (not yet adopted broadly; CSS rule covers existing pages).
- **Testing** — `iteration_17.json`: 23/23 frontend checks pass (sidebar collapse + reload persistence + group headers + emerald accent on /students /classes /fees /attendance + mobile drawer + parent portal regression).

### 2026-02-28 (this session, part 4) — Global Loader + Major Design Refresh
- **New global app loader** — `src/lib/loader.js` attaches axios interceptors that maintain a pending-request counter; `src/components/GlobalLoader.js` is a 3px top progress bar that fades in whenever any HTTP call is in flight. Mounted in Layout, LoginPage, and ParentPortal. Powered by a CSS keyframe `loader-bar` (in index.css).
- **Classes page** — Simplified card: gradient tile with BookOpen icon stacked above the class number; removed the redundant "Class X" heading text; Edit/Delete icons are always visible (no longer hover-gated) and right-aligned with proper backgrounds.
- **View Attendance — Daily Records replaced with a proper Attendance Sheet** — bordered grid, sticky Roll & Student columns, date headers with day above/month below, each cell shows a w-7 h-7 rounded letter P (emerald) / A (rose) / H (orange) / - (slate). Zebra row striping + tooltips. Legend chip row at the top.
- **Admin portal design upgrade**:
  - Dashboard: dark slate→indigo gradient hero with radial blobs, dynamic greeting (Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening), school chip, today + attendance % glass tiles
  - Stat cards now sit on a tinted gradient background with an icon tile and `ArrowUpRight` accent + sub-label
  - Quick action buttons promoted to gradient-bg buttons with arrow chevron
  - Sidebar: bg-white/80 with backdrop-blur, active item now uses sky→indigo gradient + sky shadow
- **Testing** — `iteration_16.json`: frontend 100% pass on all 5 areas (loader, classes, attendance sheet, dashboard hero, sidebar).

### 2026-02-28 (this session, part 3) — Dynamic WhatsApp Templates
- **Backend**
  - New models `WhatsAppTemplate` & `WhatsAppTemplates` in `models.py` (per event: `name` + `componentsJson` raw string)
  - New routes in `routers/operations.py`: `GET /api/settings/whatsapp-templates` and `PUT /api/settings/whatsapp-templates` (validates JSON, returns 400 on parse error)
  - `services/whatsapp.py` refactored: added `_substitute_placeholders` (regex `{{key}}` walk over nested dict/list/str), `_get_custom_template`, `_send_custom_or_default`. `send_absent_message`, `send_fee_paid_message`, `send_event_message` now check DB for custom template first and substitute placeholders before calling Meta; fall back to hardcoded defaults when not configured.
  - Placeholders: absent={{student_name}}, {{class_name}}, {{date}} · fee_paid={{amount}}, {{fee_name}}, {{student_name}}, {{invoice_url}} · event={{event_name}}, {{event_date}}
- **Frontend**
  - `Settings.js` new "Templates" tab (super_admin gated) with 3 cards (Absent / Fee Receipt / Event). Each card: Template Name input + Components-JSON textarea + "Load example" + "Use default" + chip list of available placeholders. Inline JSON validation before submit.
  - `api.js`: `getWhatsAppTemplates`, `updateWhatsAppTemplates` helpers.
- **Testing** — `iteration_15.json`: 8/8 backend + frontend pass; placeholder substitution, JSON validation, fallback-to-default, and persistence all verified.

### 2026-02-28 (this session, part 1) — Complaints Module + Dynamic School Branding
- **Backend**
  - Complaints CRUD already in `routers/operations.py`: `POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /api/complaints` + `GET /api/complaints/overdue-count`
  - Filters: `status`, `createdByUsername`, `overdueOnly`; each list row now carries computed `isOverdue` flag
  - `services/pdf.py` now embeds school logo image (base64 data URI) at the top of both Student and College receipt copies, with graceful fallback when logo is missing/invalid
- **Frontend**
  - `LoginPage.js` fetches `/api/settings/school` on mount and renders the configured `logoUrl` (replacing the default GraduationCap gradient square) and `schoolName`. "School Management System" subtitle is hidden once a custom school name is set.
  - `Layout.js` (sidebar + mobile header) now mirrors that same dynamic branding (logo + school name); polls `/api/complaints/overdue-count` every 60s for admin/super_admin and shows a numeric badge next to the Complaints nav item (rose-500 if any overdue, amber-500 otherwise).
  - `Complaints.js` (already built in prior session) verified end-to-end: photo capture (`capture="environment"`), due date, priority, status flow Pending → In Progress → Resolved, overdue alert banner for managers, filters, and delete (admin only).
  - `Dashboard.js` greeting subtitle now uses dynamic school name instead of hardcoded "SchoolPro Management System"
- **Testing** — `iteration_14.json`: 100% pass (10/10 backend + frontend e2e). No critical bugs. Optional code-review notes about role-gating DELETE /complaints and trusting client-supplied `createdBy*` fields are tracked in backlog.

### 2026-02-28 (earlier fork) — UPDATED Fee Promotion Rules
- **Backend**
  - `promote_students` rewrite per refined user spec:
    - `total_due = (T1 + T2 + T3 + applicable custom fees) − total paid (active payments)`
    - new T1 = total_due (labeled "Previous Year Due")
    - new T2 = base T2 (unchanged)
    - new T3 = base T3 + ₹5000 (new year hike for all students)
    - All previous payments archived (`status: 'archived'`) so paid resets to 0 in new year
    - Custom fees NOT carried forward — old custom fees archived; new custom fees only apply if newly created for the new class
  - `get_student_fees`, `get_fee_status`, `get_student_detail`, `parent dashboard`, `day-sheet` all skip both `reverted` and `archived` payments
  - Verified: 1000+2000+3000 fees with 400 paid → after promote: T1=5600, T2=2000, T3=8000, paid=0
  - Fixed orphaned code in `send_fee_reminders`
  - Added `POST /api/concessions/bulk` (multiple students)
  - Added `LeaveRequest` CRUD: `POST /api/leave-requests`, `GET`, `POST /{id}/approve`, `POST /{id}/reject`
- **Frontend**
  - New `/approvals` page (Approvals.js) — Leave + Concessions tabs; teacher sees Leave-only
  - ParentPortal Leave tab — date range + reason + optional file upload + history
  - Fees page Term 1 card now shows "Includes Previous Year Due" badge if `previousYearDues.amount > 0`; orange banner above term cards highlights amount + source class
  - Parent Portal Term 1 card shows "Prev Year Due" badge
  - Fees → Concessions tab: Single/Bulk mode toggle; history limited to last 4 records
  - AuthContext, Layout, App routes updated for `/approvals`
  - api.js extended; Parent Portal tabs got `data-testid`
- **Testing** — 100% pass on `iteration_10.json` (20/20 backend pytest + 3/3 frontend e2e)

### Earlier
- Custom PDF invoices (High Five International design) with sequential receipts
- External MongoDB integration
- Fee revert functionality
- Homework & Event file uploads
- Bulk student delete + pagination

## Prioritized Backlog
- **P1 — Security** Role-gate `DELETE /api/complaints/{id}` so only admin/super_admin can delete (UI already hides the button but API is open).
- **P1 — Security** Derive `createdBy*` on complaints from the authenticated session instead of trusting the client payload.
- **P2 — Refactor** `server.py` (~1586 lines) into routers: `/routes/students.py`, `/routes/fees.py`, `/routes/attendance.py`, etc.
- **P2 — Security** Add JWT/session auth tokens with route validation (currently role-based trust only)
- **P3** — Auto-mark attendance as `leave` when a leave request is approved (deferred per user: teacher still marks manually)
- **P3** — Concession bulk: checkbox selection from student list UI (current: paste student IDs textarea)
